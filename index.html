            I studied economics at my university, but it was a thing my parents recommended. I really hated it, so I dropped out. Eventually, I went into cooking and was a professional chef for 3–4 years.

            My brother is a tour guide, and a tourist did bootcamps. He mentioned this, and it inspired me. That’s when I got the money together to do one. I started Codecademy to prepare for it.

            Because I was so new to coding, and because the bootcamp was going to speed through front-end topics like CSS and HTML, I used Codecademy for that.
